DeFi elements and reward system for the Eternal Passengers. 

# What is Eternal Station?

Eternal Station is an action-adventure accessible web3 game that unites NFTs and DeFi. The game features an exploration of Eternal Worlds, collecting in-game items, crafting, and trading. Our mission is to bring fair competition to web3 where players can earn according to their skills.

Furthermore, players will be able to collaborate, enjoy story-rich gameplay, develop trading empires, compete economically with one another, and receive rewards by providing value to the game environment.

We want you to be able to display your support for other projects by utilizing your NFT (if possible) as your avatar. You will have the opportunity to replace our default avatars with yours after connecting your wallet. You might use any model that is built into our avatar system to play as a warrior, wizard, or other character. (

We are carefully collaborating with each project we integrate and create quests that teach players about DAOs, DeFi, and NFTs in addition to providing them with in-game tools for engaging with protocols.By adding a utility-driven DeFi layer on top of the fundamental gameplay, our goal is to make Web3 gaming more accessible to the general public.

Bring "trading volume" to the gaming world to get prizes. In Etarnal Station, we reward players for their contributions to the game industry, a concept known as "Create-to-Earn."

A player will be awarded with honor if they are clever and inventive enough to rapidly determine the meta for the current season and get an advantage over other players.
